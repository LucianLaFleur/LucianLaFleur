- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LucianLaFleur
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Languages and Cybersecurity
- I'm currently enrolled in a program for Google's cybersecruty certificate, but I write code that's more interesting than their bland and boring lessons.
- ğŸŒ± I have experience in web development, and I aim to do a web-app penetration testing course later
