- 👋 Hi, I’m @LucianLaFleur
- 👀 I’m interested in Blue-teaming as well as automations in Cybersecurity
- I'm currently enrolled in a program for Google's cybersecruty certificate, but I write code that's more interesting than their bland and boring lessons.
- 🌱 I have experience in web development, and I aim to do a web-app penetration testing course later
